# Starling ColorTransform

Description
------------------------------

This project contains a Starling style is based on 
[ColorOffsetStyle](https://gist.github.com/PrimaryFeather/eaaa4a1b50cf546613d2), 
offering a way to emulate color transformations in a similar way as 
[flash.geom.colorTransform](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/geom/ColorTransform.html)

To help in demonstrating and debugging [ColorTransformStyle](src/starling/extensions/ColorTransformStyle.as), a small 
Starling application is also present in this repo.

Minimum Requirements
